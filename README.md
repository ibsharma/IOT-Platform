# IOT Platform
The goal of this exercise is to build a system that works like an IoT platform â€“ in this case, a personal weight tracker. This system is responsible for:
*	Consuming data sent from different sensors (emulators)
*	Storing the received data in MongoDB
*	Running the data through different rules to make basic predictions


# Pre-requisites:
* MongoDB 3.3.0
* Maven 3.3.9
* Java8
